    "# **Neural Networks and Activation Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the application of the Convolution Neural Network(CNN) model, there is a lot of scope for improvement due to its complex architecture. Researchers had tried a lot of different ways to improve the results of the model. They had tried different image classification methods, altered learning rate used regularization techniques like Dropout, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these different methods produced better results but for the Convolution Neural Network model, activation function remains at its core. So, considering the fact that activation function plays an important role in CNNs, proper use of activation function is very much necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the function it represents, activation functions can be either linear or non-linear and are used to control the outputs neural networks. They are being used across different domains from object recognition and classification to speech recognition, segmentation, cancer detection systems, fingerprint detection, weather forecast, self-driving cars, and other domains to mention a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while implementing we had doubts about which activation function is to be used. In this article, we will go one by one to different activation functions and look deeper into their pros and cons."

    "# What is an Activation Function?\n",
    "The input layer of the neural network receives data for training which comes in different formats like images, audio, or texts. From the dataset, input features with weights and biases are used to calculate the linear function. Then, this resultant from the linear function is used by the activation function as input and calculated activations are further fed as input to the next layer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Basically, three important steps took place in a single iteration of deep neural architectures: Forward Propagation, Backward Propagation, and Gradient Descent(Optimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Forward Propagation: In this step input data is fed in the forward direction through each layer of the neural network. The linear calculation takes place in this step and the activation function is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Back Propagation: This step helps in calculating all the derivatives which will be further used for Optimization or updating the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Optimization: This step helps in the convergence of the loss function by continuously updating the parameters in each iteration. Some optimization algorithms are as follows: \n",

    "* Momentum\n",
    "* Adam\n",

    "## 01. Sigmoid Function\n",
    "* The biggest advantage that it has over other steps and linear functions is its non-linearity. The function ranges from 0 to 1 having an S shape. Also known by the name of the logistic or squashing function in some literature. The sigmoid function is used in output layers of the DNN and is used for probability-based output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its major drawbacks are sharp damp gradients during backpropagation, gradient saturation, slow convergence, and non-zero centered output thereby causing the gradient updates to propagate in different directions\n",
